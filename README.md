## Keep Employee - Predict employer turnover

## Goal
Employee turnover refers to the number or percentage of the employees who leave the company and replaced by new employees.  Employee turnover has been rampant in the company. The CFO estimates that the cost of replacing an employee is often larger than 100K USD, taking into account the time spent to interview and find a replacement, placement fees, sign-on bonuses and the loss of productivity for several months.

Our goal is to predict employee retention and understand its main drivers.
